# 1. Introduction
As a team of students about to venture into the professional world, we recognise that one of the most significant challenges that we, and many others will face, is navigating interviews and public speaking. Mastering these skills can be a daunting task and furthermore, they are crucial for the job application process. Our own struggles and experiences inspired the creation and development of our start-up: PropelAI.

We felt passionate about creating an intuitive application that will help working professionals excel at public speaking and ace interviews with confidence. This report documents our initial business execution steps and the beginning of our journey.


# 2. The Customer
## 2.1 Who is our Customer?

We identified three primary target customer groups that we deemed would most benefit from our product. Through market research we further justified this selection.

![Customers](https://github.com/abisolap123/Entrepreneurship/blob/main/customers.png)

1.	Active job seekers.
These are individuals who are currently in the process of applying for jobs and preparing for interviews. PropelAI will provide the tools needed to practice common interview scenarios and improve clarity as well as confidence of communication. 

2.	Professionals seeking career advancement.
Our application also caters to those currently employed but who are striving to migrate to a different job. Often, time is scarce for individuals in this situation; operating a full-time job alongside the search process is exhaustive. Instead of manual preparation, our application aims to streamline the process of interview preparation for a new role/ new company. 

3.	Higher education students.
These individuals could be soon to be graduates, looking to apply for a graduate scheme or a first-year student searching for an internship. Students at university or enrolled in other academic programs who are preparing to join the workforce often face the struggle of having limited interview and public speaking experience. 

Our tool presents a solution to ensuring students get the confidence and skills needed to navigate professional environments.  We wanted to create an application that we could benefit from ourselves when breaking into the job market and furthermore in our professional careers. 


## 1.2 Customer Needs
Why should you care about PropelAI?

![Speech Bubble](https://github.com/abisolap123/Entrepreneurship/blob/main/bubble.png) 

The job market has become fiercely competitive. Companies seek candidates who possess a broad range of skills, and the interview process is increasingly intensive/challenging.

PropelAI empowers individuals to build interview and public speaking confidence, put themselves ahead of the market and upskill to become a top candidate.

From our in-depth primary market research, the most prevalent challenges faced by students and working professionals when preparing for public speaking and interviews were:

1.	Anxiety/lack of confidence.
2.	Difficulty tailoring responses for specific companies/roles.

These are the needs that PropelAI aimed to address and satisfy.

## 3.1 What is the product that meets the customer needs? (Value proposition)
## 3.1.1 Product Overview 

![Homepage](https://github.com/abisolap123/Entrepreneurship/blob/main/homepage.png)

PropelAI is an intelligent interview and public speaking training platform powered by AI. The core idea is to help users become more confident and effective communicators by offering mock interview simulations, public speaking exercises, personalised coaching, and instant feedback.

The product is built around personalisation, where users enter their specific goals (e.g., applying for a marketing role at Google, preparing for a scholarship interview, delivering a class presentation, or speaking at a networking event), and the app adjusts the content, tone, and difficulty level to suit their objectives.
 Whether someone is applying for their first job, preparing for a major presentation, or aiming for a leadership promotion, PropelAI provides structured, repeatable practice sessions tailored to help users improve gradually and consistently. It supports both formal communication (interviews, pitches, speeches) and everyday speaking situations (team updates, group work, classroom participation), making it a versatile tool for personal and professional growth. 

 ## 3.1.2 How do people use it? (Real-life usage and relevance) 

 PropelAI is built to fit into real people's lives, across different needs and backgrounds:

 •	Students preparing for class presentations, thesis, group projects, or public speaking contests can use the app to rehearse and refine their delivery, tone, and structure. 
•	Job seekers use it to prepare for different interview types, from casual chats to high-stakes panel interviews, and improve storytelling around their achievements.
•	Professionals use it for improving how they speak in meetings, give updates to leadership, or pitch ideas to clients. 
•	Entrepreneurs and freelancers can rehearse product pitches, investor presentations, and networking conversations. 

The application supports different modes of communication, so it’s not only about answering questions but also about: 

•	Structuring thoughts logically.
•	Using confident body language and tone. 
•	Controlling filler words and awkward pauses. 
•	Building strong introductions and conclusions.

## 3.1.3 How it fits into customers’ lives? 
PropelAI is designed to seamlessly integrate into the everyday routine of users:

•	Students can use it to rehearse interview questions for internships or graduate schemes.
•	Professionals can practice for job interviews, client presentations, or team briefings. 
•	Educators or institutions can assign it as a soft skills training tool to enhance classroom engagement and communication development. 
•	Anyone with stage fright or fear of public speaking can build confidence gradually through private, self-paced sessions.

By offering flexible access and practice-on-demand, users can prepare from home, while commuting, or in between work and study hours, without the need for expensive coaching or live sessions.

## 3.1.4 Commercialising it in a sustainable manner (business model) 

PropelAI follows a freemium and scalable business model that ensures both social impact and business sustainability. 

1.	Free Tier: 
o	Basic access to mock interview simulations and public speaking scenarios. 
o	Limited daily practice.
o	Basic speech feedback (e.g., speed, filler words, volume).

2.	Premium Tier (Individuals): 
o	Subscription-based access (monthly or annual). 
o	Features like role-specific training, AI-generated model answers, voice tone and pace analytics, custom speaking exercises (e.g., elevator pitch, TED-style talks). 
o	Personalised learning paths based on user goals.

3.	Institutional Partnerships (B2B): 
o	Universities and colleges can offer the platform to students as part of career services or academic development. 
o	Corporate HR or L&D teams can use PropelAI for employee communication training, onboarding, or leadership development.

This approach ensures that: 
•	The product is affordable to those who need it most. 
•	Revenue comes from multiple channels (B2C + B2B). 
•	The product remains scalable, as the AI backend allows for high-quality coaching without hiring human trainers.


## 3.1.5 Real value delivered to users (not just features)

PropelAI’s value isn’t only in its features, but in how it makes a real difference in people’s confidence, communication, and career. Here’s how:
•	Builds real-world communication skills – not just for interviews, but for meetings, presentations, pitches, and group discussions. 

•	Reduces speaking anxiety – through repetition, feedback, and a safe space to practice. 
•	Saves time – no need to book coaches or search the internet for tips; everything is built into the app. 
•	Prepares users for life – communication is a lifelong skill, and PropelAI helps build it from the ground up.
