| As a team of students about to venture into the professional world,   |
| we recognise that one of the most significant challenges that we, and |
| many others will face, is navigating interviews and public speaking.  |
| Mastering these skills can be a daunting task and furthermore, they   |
| are crucial for the job application process. Our own struggles and    |
| experiences inspired the creation and development of our start-up:    |
| PropelAI.                                                             |

| We felt passionate about creating an intuitive application that will  |
| help working professionals excel at public speaking and ace           |
| interviews with confidence. This report documents our initial         |
| business execution steps and the beginning of our journey.            |

| We identified three primary target customer groups that we deemed     |

| These individuals could be soon to be graduates, looking to apply for |
| a graduate scheme or a first-year student searching for an            |

SECTION II: THE PRODUCT

2.1) What is the product that meets the customer needs? (Value
proposition)

2.1.1. Overview of the Product

![A screenshot of a web page Description automatically
generated](media/image11.png){width="4.158333333333333in"
height="2.7180555555555554in"}PropelAI is an intelligent interview and
public speaking training platform powered by AI. The core idea is to
help users become more confident and effective communicators by offering
mock interview simulations, public speaking exercises, personalised
coaching, and instant feedback.

The product is built around personalisation, where users enter their
specific goals (e.g., applying for a marketing role at Google, preparing
for a scholarship interview, delivering a class presentation, or
speaking at a networking event), and the app adjusts the content, tone,
and difficulty level to suit their objectives.

Whether someone is applying for their first job, preparing for a major
presentation, or aiming for a leadership promotion, PropelAI provides
structured, repeatable practice sessions tailored to help users improve
gradually and consistently. It supports both formal communication
(interviews, pitches, speeches) and everyday speaking situations (team
updates, group work, classroom participation), making it a versatile
tool for personal and professional growth.

2.1.2. How do people use it? (Real-life usage and relevance)

![A poster of a group of people Description automatically
generated](media/image12.png){width="4.875in"
height="3.6756944444444444in"}PropelAI is built to fit into real
people\'s lives, across different needs and backgrounds:

- **Students** preparing for class presentations, thesis, group
  projects, or public speaking contests can use the app to rehearse and
  refine their delivery, tone, and structure.

- **Job seekers** use it to prepare for different interview types, from
  casual chats to high-stakes panel interviews, and improve storytelling
  around their achievements.

- **Professionals** use it for improving how they speak in meetings,
  give updates to leadership, or pitch ideas to clients.

- **Entrepreneurs** and **freelancers** can rehearse product pitches,
  investor presentations, and networking conversations.

The application supports different modes of communication, so it's not
only about answering questions but also about:

- Structuring thoughts logically.

- Using confident body language and tone.

- Controlling filler words and awkward pauses.

- Building strong introductions and conclusions.

2.1.3. How it fits into customers' lives?

PropelAI is designed to seamlessly integrate into the everyday routine
of users:

- ![A poster of a person working on a computer Description automatically
  generated](media/image13.png){width="3.4881944444444444in"
  height="4.382638888888889in"}Students can use it to **rehearse**
  interview questions for internships or graduate schemes.

- Professionals can **practice** for job interviews, client
  presentations, or team briefings.

- Educators or institutions can assign it as a **soft skills training
  tool** to enhance **classroom engagement** and **communication
  development.**

- Anyone with stage fright or fear of public speaking can build
  confidence gradually through **private, self-paced** sessions.

By offering flexible access and practice-on-demand, users can prepare
from home, while commuting, or in between work and study hours, without
the need for expensive coaching or live sessions.

2.1.4. Commercialising it in a sustainable manner (business model)

PropelAI follows a freemium and scalable business model that ensures
both social impact and business sustainability.

1.  **Free Tier:**

- Basic access to mock interview simulations and public speaking
  scenarios.

- Limited daily practice.

- Basic speech feedback (e.g., speed, filler words, volume).

2.  **Premium Tier (Individuals):**

- Subscription-based access (monthly or annual).

- Features like role-specific training, AI-generated model answers,
  voice tone and pace analytics, custom speaking exercises (e.g.,
  elevator pitch, TED-style talks).

- Personalised learning paths based on user goals.

3.  **Institutional Partnerships (B2B):**

- Universities and colleges can offer the platform to students as part
  of career services or academic development.

- Corporate HR or L&D teams can use PropelAI for employee communication
  training, onboarding, or leadership development.

generated](media/image14.png){width="4.1402777777777775in"
height="4.174305555555556in"}

This approach ensures that:

- The product is **affordable** to those who need it most.

- **Revenue** comes from **multiple channels** (B2C + B2B).

- The product remains **scalable**, as the AI backend allows for
  high-quality coaching without hiring human trainers.

2.1.5. Real value delivered to users (not just features)

PropelAI's value isn't only in its features, but in how it makes a real
difference in people's confidence, communication, and career. Here's
how:

- Builds **real-world** communication skills -- not just for interviews,
  but for meetings, presentations, pitches, and group discussions.

- **Reduces** speaking **anxiety** -- through repetition, feedback, and
  a safe space to practice.

- Saves **time** -- no need to book coaches or search the internet for
  tips; everything is built into the app.

- **Prepares** users for life -- communication is a lifelong skill, and
  PropelAI helps build it from the ground up.
